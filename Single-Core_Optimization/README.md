# Single-Core Optmization

This folder collects the slides, example codes and additional materials focused on writing efficient serial code on a single core.

The aim is to illustrate how profoundly the peculiarities of modern CPU architecture impact on the way a C/C++ code must be written to exploit their potential - or at least not to incur in severe penalties.

The slides are organized as follows:

| Topic                                     | description                                                  | file                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |

| CPU architecture                          | the fundamental traits of modern CPU architecture,  elements of their historical developments and of the impact they have on programming | `01--Modern_architecture.pdf`                            |
| Preliminary concepts and compiler’s usage | Some gentle introduction on “optimization” at large; how to use (some) compiler’s options | `00--Optimization--preliminaries_and_compiler_usage.pdf` |
| The running model                         | Traits of the running model; the virtual memory address space, the TLB, the stack, the heap | `02--optimization--heap_and_stack.pdf`                   |
| First steps                               | Very basic concepts and trivial mistakes to be avoided       | `03--optimization--basic_steps.pdf`                      |
| Optimization techniques                   | Fundamental techniques on writing efficient codes accounting for caches, ILP, SIMD, pipelines, branches | `Single-core__cache_branches_pipelines_loops.pdf`        |
| Sparse topics of interest                 | How to measure performance, overview of pointers, integer representation | `topics.pdf`                                             |

For every main topic, there are example codes that illustrate its traits, as follows
